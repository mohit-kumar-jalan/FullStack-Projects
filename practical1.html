    <p>
        Everything you have ever seen on the web is considered ‘front end’. Front end is what we see when we open a web
        page or app. Code is downloaded from a server and is rendered to the screen by a web browser. What happens when
        we interact with the code is also considered front end. This is often referred to as the ‘Presentation Layer’ or
        ‘Client’ in software development terms.

        The front end is built out of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows us to put content on our
        page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc. CSS is used to style our page. It allows the contents to
        have different text colors, background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning of the content on the
        page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic.
